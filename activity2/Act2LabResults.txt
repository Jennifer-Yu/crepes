Start
• My mother and I talked last night.
    - "Tell me more about your family."
• I said no!
    - "Why so negative?"
• The weather is nice.
    - "You don't say."
• Do you know my brother?
    - "Why so negative?" (because it has "no" in it) LOOL ????!!
    
Keyword and Responses
    1. "cake"
        -"Sounds delicious"
    2. "exam"
        -"A Day of Relaxation? Sounds awesome!"
    3. "yes"
        -"I love the positive attitude!"
    
What happens when more than one keyword appears in a string? Consider the string “My
mother has a dog but no cat.” Explain how to prioritize responses in the reply method.
    - The response to this would be "Why so negative?" because "no" is the first keyword addressed.
    (That answer is surprisingly accurate, but that's beside the point.) The words that are most
    specific or appear the most frequently should be prioritized because they would provide the
    best answers.
    
Question
1. What happens when a keyword is included in another word? Consider statements like “I know
all the state capitals” and “I like vegetables smothered in cheese.” Explain the problem with the
responses to these statements.
    - If the keyword is included in another word, it will trigger that keyword's response.  For
    example, "Do you know my brother?" triggers the response "Why so negative?" because "know"
    has the word "no" in it.  This is an inappropiate response to the initial question.
    Possible solutions: A more universal response to no or checking if no is the actual word used, 
    such as by checking to see if there are characters suppounding the phrase (maybe replace "no" with " no ")
